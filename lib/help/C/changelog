v1.0.0 - March 27th 2020
FIXED:
  - The mud was not outputting an IAC,GA after prompts. I modified the socket
    code to spit this out after busting a prompt. Other editors may not have
    this, but the GA will fix some lags/delays in popular clients.
  - AutoDoc used backspace overprints, 'doc' was illegible, fixed it.
  
MODIFIED:
  - Moved most sane options to /lib/muddata including port, paths, messaging,
    and formatting options. This required changing the boot order (so that 
    the port is read later for the sockets)
  - Changed the SCons slightly (adding libm, essentially) to make sure the mud
    compiled on current versions of Linux; will test this out cross-platform 
    at a later date.
  - [Mudlib] Modified look in rooms to create both a short and long view of
    the exits.
  - Naming consistency (NGenMud) and branding changed throughout
  - MOTD and GREETING modified to update and bring in line with naming
  
ADDED:
  - "heartbeat" hook was added with a pulse of once per 2 seconds, this is
    intended to give scripts an easy timer.
  - .gitignore file with sane settings for NGenMud
  - text for who display
