  NGenMud is a modification of NGenMud created in order to finish the work
  of moving as much possible back towards the Python side of the house. Since my
  background was in LPC, I felt a push towards that dynamic separaTION.

  Thanks go out to Brian Graversen for creating SocketMud(tm), which NGenMud
  was built on top of. I know nothing (yet) about TCP/IP, and SocketMud(tm) made 
  my life that much easier.
