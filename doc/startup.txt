Starting
-----------
Startup should be pretty easy once you've compiled/built. With SCons, everything
should compile automagically.

Simply type ./ngenmud [port] & If you do not supply a port, the MUD will
start up on port 5555 by default.

Building
-----------
SCONS: (might need to install: i.e. debian: sudo apt-get install scons)
To build, simply run `scons`. To clean, run `scons -c` (unlike Make,
SCons can work out what it's built and delete it). To make a backup,
run `scons backup` (caveat: this won't clean first like the Makefile
does. You'll have to run `scons -c` by hand).

MAKE:
To compile, simply go into the src directory and type "make". You will likely
need to read/edit the src/scripts/module.mk (instructions in file) to ensure 
that you are pointing at the right Python. SCons is a better choice for 
building.
